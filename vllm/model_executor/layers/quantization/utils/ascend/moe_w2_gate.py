"""Confidence-gated FP4 re-forward for the 2-bit MoE path (directive 2 / Step B).

When the 2-bit base emits a LOW-CONFIDENCE decode token, this gate re-runs the
step with the token's routed experts pulled up to FP4 (via the delta tier's
`force_promote`) and re-decides. Offline validation on a coding corpus
(gate_validate.py) showed that gating on `max_prob <= 0.67` (~30% of tokens)
recovers ~90% of the 2-bit->FP4 top-1 agreement gap and ~61% of the PPL gap;
`max_prob` is the cleanest signal (matches AUROC 0.916).

This module is the *decision + orchestration* half (pure, env-gated, no graph
surgery). The *re-forward* itself is one extra CUDA-graph replay driven by the
model runner, which reads the updated `slot_table` and recomputes the promoted
experts at FP4. Everything is OFF unless `VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE=1`, so the prod
serving path is byte-for-byte unchanged by default.

Why the orchestration is out-of-graph (see CONFIDENCE_GATE_NEXT_SESSION.md):
the trigger (`max_prob` of THIS step's logits) is a runtime branch on a GPU
value, the forced promotion is synchronous + variable-size, and the re-run is a
2nd forward — none of which fit the captured one-graph-per-step cadence. The
re-forward CAN be a graph replay; only steps (a) read confidence, (b) force
promote, (c) trigger the replay are eager.

Env knobs:
  VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE         0 (default) | 1     master switch
  VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE_SIGNAL  max_prob (default) | margin
  VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE_TAU     fire if signal <= TAU. Default 0.60 for max_prob, 1.5
                           nats for margin. Pure quality<->latency knob. At 0.60
                           (measured, coding): fires ~16% of steps, precision ~46%
                           (FP4 differs from 2-bit there), 4.2x lift over the 10.8%
                           base disagreement, ~68% recall -- the efficiency knee
                           before added re-runs go mostly redundant. Raise toward
                           0.70-0.80 for more recall once a functional eval confirms
                           the FP4 upgrades are correct; lower to 0.50 if marginal.
  VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE_MAX_PROMOTE  cap experts force-promoted per fired step
                                (default 64; 0 = unlimited). The cap is a
                                STABILIZER, not just a latency bound —
                                measured both ways on DS4 (2026-07-13):
                                - uncapped, LONG-form generation (GPQA
                                  Diamond, drifting working sets): pool
                                  churns wholesale on every fire and the
                                  FP4 set mutates mid-answer — 60.6% vs
                                  70.2% capped (McNemar p=0.002); small
                                  pools also blow up short-form token
                                  length (+110% on an 85-slot pool).
                                - capped 64, SHORT-form (GSM8K): capped
                                  and uncapped tie at big pools (97.0 vs
                                  97.5, n.s.); capped never measured
                                  worse than uncapped end-to-end.
                                Incremental promotion + need-ranking
                                accumulates the true hard core across
                                fires; promotions persist. Raise/0 only
                                for short-form serving with a pool >= the
                                per-step routed set, where fires then
                                cover their whole step (and see the

  VLLM_MOE_W2_GATE_FP_MAX  max promote->replay iterations per fired step
                           (default 3). A single replay is only FIRST-order:
                           upgraded early layers re-route later layers onto
                           still-cold experts inside the replay, which then
                           decide the token at 2-bit (measured on GPQA:
                           tau=1.00 66.2% vs 72.2% when a big pool hid the
                           residue; GSM8K showed no gap - stable routing).
                           The loop iterates until no rank promotes; steady
                           state costs nothing (first check promotes 0).
